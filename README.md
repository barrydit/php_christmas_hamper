# php_christmas_hamper
Donated / Volunteer Christmas Hamper for PHP. Self-installs

Its still a project in progress. But I thought I would share it by uploading it to github.
The image is a bit dated, but it goes to show how the web application works.

I have added additional code for composer to unpack and execute an update command, there by createing /vendor and the associated libraries.

I would like to further add some code by adding the ability to add github oauth token to the auth.json file on the clients computer. The login details are root : password
